        <h2>The hardware</h2>
        <p>
          There’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi 2</a> inside, so you can either follow our guide and run <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> on it, or install your favorite operating system on its powerful 900 MHz quad-core ARM processor.
        </p>

        <p>
          freetserv uses the <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT4232H.htm">FT4232HL chip</a>, which is well-supported by Linux and BSD operating systems. No custom drivers are needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinout">Pinout</a>-wise, freetserv is compatible with the popular cisco console cables that you might already be familiar with.
        </p>

        <h2>Why use serial ports?</h2>

        <p>
          freetserv originated from a small server hosting colocation association where we share a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack">19″ rack</a>; each member gets one unit.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some devices like network switches or appliances come with a serial port and no other way to access them remotely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Servers often have more modern remote management facilities like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface">IPMI</a>, but we weren’t too happy with that, no matter which server vendor we are talking about. Occasionally, the IPMI module would just crash (!) and need a reboot. Sometimes IPMI wasn’t reachable in early boot when you needed it most due to its network port sharing. And even when it works, it provides a huge attack surface.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, some of our members prefer to turn off IPMI and use a good old serial port instead. Others take all the backup they can get and want to have both IPMI and serial port access.
